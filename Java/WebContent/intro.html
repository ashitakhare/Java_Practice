		<h3>JAVA</h3>
	</CENTER>
	<p>
		Java is a programming language and a computing platform for
		application development. It was first released by Sun Microsystem in
		1995 and later acquired by Oracle Corporation. A Java platform
		includes an execution engine, a compiler and a set of libraries. Java
		is not specific to any processor or operating system. Like C compiler,
		Java compiler does not produce native executable code for a particular
		machine. Instead, Java produces a unique format called bytecode. It
		executes according to the rules laid out in the virtual machine
		specification. Java is free to access, and you can download the latest
		version from <a href="https://java.com/en/">here.</a>

					<p>Each, OS like Windows,Linux etc. have there own Compilers
						therefore if a code written in window based OS can be only
						compiled on Windows Platform, Similarly, Code written in LINUX or
						any other OS/Platform cannot be compiled on another. What if we
						need to run it on another system.</p>
					<p>There are 2 Possibilities:
					<ol>
						<li>Write the same code again and again on different
							platform, As a developer, I want my software program to work on
							all platforms available, to maximize my revenues. So I would have
							to buy separate compilers OR</li>
						<li><b>Use JAVA.</b></li>
					</ol>
					<p>Because, By using Java Virtual Machine, these problem can be
						solved.</p>

						<li>The code to display saved as .java file as shown in above
							image.</li>
						<li>Using the java compiler the code is converted into an
							intermediate code called the bytecode. The output is a .class
							file.</li>
						<li>This code is not understood by any platform, but only a
							virtual platform called the Java Virtual Machine</li>
						<li>This Virtual Machine resides in the RAM of your operating
							system. When the Virtual Machine is fed with this bytecode, it
							identifies the platform it is working on and converts the
							bytecode into the native machine code</li>

					</ol>
					<h4>Hence, java is a language as well as a platform (JVM)</h4>

						JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine. It is the engine that drives
						the Java Code. It converts Java bytecode into machines language.<br>
					<ul>
						<li>In other programming language, the compiler produces code
							for a particular system. But Java compiler produces code for a
							Virtual Machine.</li>
						<li>In JVM, Java code is compiled into bytecode. This
							bytecode gets interpreted on different machines</li>
						<li>Between host system and Java source, Bytecode is an
							intermediary language.</li>
						<li>JVM is responsible for allocating a memory space.</li>
					</ul>
					The Java VM or Java Virtual Machine resides on the RAM. During
					execution, using the class loader the class files are brought on
					the RAM. <br>

					<p>Next, the execution engine will convert the Bytecode into
						Native machine code. This is just in time compiling. It is one of
						the main reason why Java is comparatively slow.</p>
